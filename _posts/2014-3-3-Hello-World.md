Is it too late for a New Years Resolution blog post? Probably.

But last year I realised that I'm really bad at doing lots of things well, so instead I'll focus on Just One Thing™. Typically a make a list of things that are nice to haves, then maybe finish one or two of them by the end of the year. 

Last year my biggest goal was I climbed a V6 (!!!!). I had a few other fitness achievements such as finishing the Tongariro Crossing really quickly. But overall these weren't things I had to push myself for and work towards. I had some really awesome career accomplishments which are driving some more success right at the start of this year with PhD applications. But honestly these are just a result of me being lucky. I stay fairly active, I'm already in a great program at school with an awesome advisor. 

I fell short of a few other goals I set such as cutting fat to the point I have visible abs. I really wanted to read more and learn more because I just enjoy learning. I read a textbook from front to back and just really loved every minute of it. I meant to start a meditation practice and write in a journal. I even wanted a blog. The list goes on and on and on. But that's the problem. 

All of those goals are accomplishable, I laid out a plan to get to each one and somewhat of a timeline. But it's just too much. This year I have a different approach and so far I've actually been pretty successful.

**Just One Thing.**™

I did make a list of things I wanted this year, but I've already forgotten it (I still want them, especially if I read it again). I've decided instead to revisit this list every time I accomplish my one thing. So far my one thing was swimming. I want to be able to jump off a boat and not think I'm going to drown. I started swimming at my condo pool and it is SO easy. I can't believe it. I can backstroke more than four laps without touching the bottom or sides. So the next step was deep water. My roommate Jad joined diving lessons. I joined diving lessons. And despite being as clumsy as a "fish out of water" in the water, I'm really enjoying them. I did a cool front
