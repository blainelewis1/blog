Is it too late for a New Years Resolution blog post? Probably.

Last year I climbed a V6 (!!!!). This was a huge accomplishment and a goal for 2018. Careerwise, I set myself up for great opportunities like PhD programs, research assistantships and even a top-notch internship. I started some successful collaborations resulting in my first two papers. I'm really proud of everything I did in 2018. The thing is, these aren't year long goals. Realistically these took at most a few weeks of really hard work. But what I really want from my yearly goals is a significant impact on my life with a permanent change.

I fell short of a few other goals like cutting fat to the point I have visible abs. I really wanted to read more and learn more because I just enjoy learning. And I did start that, I read a textbook from front to back and just really loved every minute of it. I meant to start a meditation practice and write in a journal, there's some scraps of journals and I did meditate maybe 60 days last year. I even wanted a blog. The list goes on and on and on. But that's the problem. It's not that I didn't plan these (I did). It's not that I didn't schedule them (I did). It's not even that I don't really want these things (I DO). But, you'll notice there's a pattern to the goals I fell short of. They're really long term to accomplish, and involve a significant and permanent impact to my life.

But that kind of goal is *hard*. And I had like 10 of them!! So this year I need something new. 

**Just One Thing.**â„¢

This year started the same. And now we're in February and the year is already flying by. I HAVE accomplished some more short term things I am very proud of (we can circle back to these later). The thing is, I'm still not getting those long term goals. So it's February and I'm changing my tone.

This year I have only one goal: get better at forming habits. 

I'm not overwhelmed by this goal, I can definitely accomplish it. And it's something really, really important to me. Becoming skilled at habit formation is going to change my life for the better. In fact I've already formed a habit this year with a positive impact. I make my bed. every. single. morning. It's made me so much happier, if I spend 1 minute a day making my bed, I can use my couch as soon as I get home from work and my bed isn't covering the entire living room. Toronto rent is heavy. But sleeping on a pull-out couch in your friends living room isn't.

The nice thing about doing just one thing is that the shorter term goals are still happening. This year I overcame my fear of swimming and I've spent several hours in the pool. I started a new hobby, springboard diving. And I'm well on my way towards accomplishing some other really awesome stuff!
