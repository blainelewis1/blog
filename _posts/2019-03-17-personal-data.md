## Personal Data

I love capturing data about myself. But capturing data is tedious, and sometimes the value isn't that obvious. I'm trying to build a toolset to help me do all of this. There's three principles I want to embrace to make this successful: make capturing data less tedious, actively show the value of the data, and create value for data that didn't have value before. 

My previous post about Pom Pilot is a first step towards that. It creates value by helping me use a technique I've tried on and off to use. And it makes capturing data less tedious because it saves me at least two steps. I plan to build an entire suite of tools that help me capture data and use the data I capture. Some of these are very technical like Pom Pilot, but others like my budget spreadsheet are less technical. For two years I kept every single receipt I had and recorded an itemised version in a spreadsheet. I spend a lot of money on butter.

In fact, I've often wondered what I would need to do to capture "all" of the data. And when I say all, I do really mean everything. How much water did I drink? How many pages of a book? How many grams of magnesium did I consume? These are all very numeric and quantifiable (albeit hard). They're easy in the sense that I consumed them in an active manner. There are other harder questions like, how productive was I today? How many people wearing Chelsea Boots and rolled up pants did I see today? 

A lot of this data IS caputred by the services I use, like how many pages did I read today. I'm sure that Adobe PDF reader records the pages I read, and Play books records how many pages I read. But I don't have access to this data.
