Is it too late for a New Years Resolution blog post? Probably.

In hindsight, last year was an incredible year. Probably one of my best. But I'm still coming into 2019 thinking I could have done more. Let's start by going over the things I did do. I climbed a V6 (!!!). This was something I explicitly set out for and wanted to accomplish. In my career I published my first paper and laid the groudwork for several more. I reviewed my first CHI paper which is evidence that my hard work to be an expert in my field is not only paying off, but being recognised by people I look up to. 

But the thing is. I would have accomplished those things with or without making them goals. I didn't step outside of my comfort zone or have to work particularly hard. I climb three times a week, of course I'm going to get better. This year I'd love to send a 5.12 on top rope and start leading a little bit harder. There's a pattern in the goals I didn't accomplish. They all need long term hard work. 

I wanted to start a meditation practice. And I started to, I had at least 23 consecutive days meditating and probably a total of 60 days throughout the year. I wanted to read a textbook every month or two, and a paper every weekday. I also wanted to cut fat to the point I have visible abs. There's a pattern here if you haven't noticed. They all need some form of underlying habit and a permanent change to my life.

But that kind of goal is *hard*. And I had like 10 of them!! So this year I need something new. 

**Just One Thing.**â„¢

This year started the same. And now we're in ~February~ March and the year is already flying by. I HAVE accomplished some more short term things I am very proud of (we can circle back to these later). The thing is, I'm still not getting those long term goals. So it's March now and I'm changing my tone.

This year I have only one goal: get better at forming habits. 

I'm not overwhelmed by this goal, I can definitely accomplish it. And it's something really, really important to me. Becoming skilled at habit formation is going to change my life for the better. In fact I've already formed a habit this year with a positive impact. I make my bed. every. single. morning. I'm way more proud of this than I should be, but I'm going to cling to it.

The nice thing about doing just one thing is that the shorter term goals are still happening. This year I overcame my fear of swimming and I've spent several hours in the pool. I started a new hobby, springboard diving. And I'm well on my way towards accomplishing some other really awesome stuff! 

These types of goals are going to happen anyways because of who I am. The goals I really want to do are the ones that need to perturb who I am towards a slightly better me.
