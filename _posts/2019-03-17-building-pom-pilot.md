## Pom Pilot

In my last post I briefly mentioned a new tool I built called Pom Pilot. I'm going to describe a bit better my process and tools I used for building Pom Pilot.


Pom Pilot is a part of a bigger set of tools I've wanted to make and combines some technology I really like. 

Browser Only web development: maintaining and paying for servers is difficult and expensive. Often, we can just put everything in the browser. It obviously limits our functionality. Things like push notifications are impossible without a server. And it also means it doesn't work out of the box because I won't be sharing my API key.
