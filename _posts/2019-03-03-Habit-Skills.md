# Habits

This isn't a new idea. And I've never been a fan of it when I encountered it before. But this is different, I promise.

Just about all of our behaviour can be described using habits. We receive a cue, perform an action, and sometimes we get a reward. This framework to dissect human behaviour is very enticing because it simplifies us to simple if statements. If walk in door tired from work, sit on couch, receive comfort. It's obviously a simplistic model. But for our purpose maybe it makes self improvement easier. t

The Power of Habits and many other books try to give us super easy methods to understanding and building habits. But it's the wrong framework. Rather than focusing on habits we want we can take another approach: form habits because we can. If we learn how to make a habit, like we would any other skill like writing blogs or climbing, then we might be able to apply that to habits we really want.
