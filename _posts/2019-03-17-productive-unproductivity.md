## Productive Unproductivity and Building Things I Can Actually Use

Sometimes getting work done is really, really hard. I just don't feel like it. Fortunately, I'm in a field where I get to do the things I love, day in and day out. Unfortunately, it still happens. But what I do with those days is still really important. In fact, I relish them because sometimes they turn into the most fun days. 

This week was one of those weeks. I came in on Monday super late because I was jetlagged, I didn't finish much at all. And then on Tuesday I came in (before 9am!!) and finished a ton of work. And then almost nothing all day Wednesday, or even Thursday. But I realised that I salvaged Tuesday in part because I combined two techniques: Pomodoro, which I've toyed with once in a while, and putting all of my tasks in Google Calendar events (thank you Greg). 

I'm not a fan of the Pomodoro timer I used, and enterring events in Google Calendar was very tedious. So on Thursday night and Friday I buit [Pom Pilot](https://blainelewis1.github.io/pom-pilot). It's a Pomodor timer that automatically enters your Poms for you. 

I love that I can build things I actually use in my day to day life and even though I don't always get lots done I can still finish something valuable. Creating Pom Pilot used some of the same technologies as I would have been using to do my real work anyways...
